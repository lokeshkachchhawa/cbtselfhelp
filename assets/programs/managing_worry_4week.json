    "shortDescription": "A practical 4-week program (28 short lessons) teaching evidence-informed strategies to notice, test and reduce worry — includes brief practices, behavioural experiments and journaling prompts.",
    "description": "Over four weeks you'll learn how worry works, how to spot unhelpful worry habits, test anxious predictions, plan small experiments, use acceptance and problem-solving, and build a maintenance routine. Each daily lesson is short (5–15 min) and includes a micro-practice and a prompt that can be saved to the Thought Record or ABCD tools.",
