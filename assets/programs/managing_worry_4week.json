    "description": "Over four weeks you'll learn how worry works, how to spot unhelpful worry habits, test anxious predictions, plan small experiments, use acceptance and problem-solving, and build a maintenance routine. Each daily lesson is short (5–15 min) and includes a micro-practice and a prompt that can be saved to the Thought Record or ABCD tools.",
